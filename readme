        +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+

    It is strongly recommended that the user do a complete install of all
    components to ensure that this driver works correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Installation

    3.1. Login as 'root' before executing the following instructions.

    3.2. Uncompress the driver
    # tar zxvf adv_17V35X-VerX.tar.gz

    3.3. Build the driver
      # cd adv_17V35X
      # make
    Note:
      To compile the source code, you must install kernel development header
      file package,"gcc" and "make" command.

    3.4. Install the driver module
    # make install
    or
    #insmod ./adv17v35x.ko
    to see whether ttyAPn or ttyBnPn ( n = 1,2,3...) exist in /dev/ folder.

    3.5. Uninstall the driver module and clean
    # make uninstall
    # make clean
    or
    #rmmod adv17v35x

    3.6 Verify driver installation
    You may run command "dmesg" to check the latest status log reported by
    this driver whenever it's activated.

    This module registers Advantech ports as "/dev/ttyAP0", "/dev/ttyAP1", etc.
    Use "minicom" or your custom serial application to test the ports

    Attention! The name of PCIE-16XX ports are the same as Old cards which use
    Oxford chip, so don't use them at the same time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Driver files and device naming convention

    The driver file may be obtained via email. The first step, anyway, is to
    copy driver file "adv_17V35X-VerX" into specified
    directory. e.g. /advantech. The execute commands as below.

    # cd /advantech/adv_17V35X-VerX

    You may find the driver source code in /advantech/adv_17V35X-VerX.

    Driver creates traditional serial device names, "/dev/ttyAP0" onwards.

    Device naming when multiple boards are installed
    -----------------------------------------------
    assuming 2 PCIE-1602 boards, 1 PCIE-1610 board and
    1 PCIE-1622 board.

    Board Num.              Port Name
    1st board (1602)        ttyAP0  - ttyAP1
    2nd board (1602)        ttyAP2  - ttyAP3
    3rd board (1610)        ttyAP4  - ttyAP7
    4th board (1622)        ttyAP8  - ttyAP15

    Note. We don't know which card be found first, maybe 1602, or 1610, or
    1622. This depends on the sequence that operating system scanning.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How to use Fixed Number

    From the latest version (v5.0.3.0) on, we'll add the new feature
    callled Fixed Number.

    This function enables the user to alternate the PCI/PCIE card slot without
    changing the name of the device node generated by each port.

    5.1 Using the old naming "ttyAPn"
    You'll find a switch called "Board ID" on the card. Adjust the switch
    to "ON".

    5.2 Using Fixed Number "ttyBnPn"
    Naming: "ttyB" + Board ID + "P" + Index, such as "ttyB03P0", "ttyB15P1", etc.
    You'll find a switch called "Board ID" on the card. Adjust the switch to
    the opposite side of "ON", i.e. the non-zero value. For example, if you
    want to generate a device node for "ttyB03Pn", you need to set "Board ID"
    to 0x3.

6. Troubleshooting

    The boot time error messages and solutions are stated as clearly as
    possible. If all the possible solutions fail, please contact our technical
    support team to get more help.
